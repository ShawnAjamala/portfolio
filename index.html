  </body><h4>Personal information</h4>
  <p>
    Jomo Kenyatta was born to <i>Kamau Wa Muigai to parents Muigai and Wambi.</i> They
    were ordinary people whose main preoccupation was farming in Gatundu
    village. The exact date of Kenyatta’s birth is not known for certain but is
    presumed to be around 1895. Kenyatta was born some twenty-five miles
    north-east of Fort Smith at Ngenda, a land of sugar cane and cattle pasture
    where two rivers met. After Kenyatta’s birth and his passage from infancy to
    childhood, Muigai and Wambui had another son, Kungu. Earlier, there had been
    an older boy also called Kongo who had died. The second Kongo bore the same
    name as Muigai’s father. Among the traditional African communities, a child
    learnt many skills from the father depending on what the father was thus
    Kenyatta spent most of his childhood herding the family’s flock, usually
    with other boys from neighboring families.
