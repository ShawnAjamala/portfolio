  <h1>JOMO'S WORK</h1>
  <body>
    <p>
      Jomo Kenyatta[a] CGH (c. 1897 – 22 August 1978) was a Kenyan anti-colonial
      activist and politician who governed Kenya as its Prime Minister from 1963
      to 1964 and then as its first President from 1964 to his death in 1978. He
      played a significant role in the transformation of Kenya from a colony of
      the British Empire into an independent republic. Ideologically an African
      nationalist and a conservative, he led the Kenya African National Union
      (KANU) party from 1961 until his death.
